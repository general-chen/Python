The formula dcl_arr = (df_arr/f_arr) + 2*(drho/rho) + (du/u) + 2*(darea/area) can be derived using the first-order Taylor series expansion of the lift coefficient cl about the nominal values of the input variables.

The first-order Taylor series expansion of a function f(x1, x2, ..., xn) about the point (a1, a2, ..., an) is given by:

**f(x1, x2, ..., xn) ≈ f(a1, a2, ..., an) + (∂f/∂x1)*(x1-a1) + (∂f/∂x2)*(x2-a2) + ... + (∂f/∂xn)*(xn-an)**

In the case of the lift coefficient, the input variables are f, rho, u, and area, and their nominal values are given by the mean values of the measured data. Assuming that the uncertainties in the input variables are small, we can approximate the lift coefficient using a first-order Taylor series expansion as:

<strong>cl ≈ cl_mean + (∂cl/∂f)*df + (∂cl/∂ρ)*dρ + (∂cl/∂u)*du + (∂cl/∂area)*darea</strong>


where cl_mean is the mean value of the lift coefficient, and df, drho, du, and darea are the uncertainties in f, rho, u, and area, respectively.

Taking the partial derivatives of cl with respect to each input variable, we get:

**∂cl/∂f = 1 / (0.5*rho*u*2*area)**

<strong>∂cl/∂rho = -0.5*f / (rho^2*u*2*area)<strong>

**∂cl/∂u = -0.5*f / (rho*u^2*2*area)**

**∂cl/∂area = -0.5*f / (rho*u*2*area*2)**

Substituting these expressions into the Taylor series expansion for cl, we get:

**cl ≈ cl_mean + df/f + 2*drho/rho + du/u + 2*darea/area**
    
While the formula is derived using the Taylor series expansion, it can also be interpreted as a formula for calculating the uncertainty in cl due to uncertainties in the input variables.
