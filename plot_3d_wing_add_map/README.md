# This code defines a function "plotWing", and use plotly to create a 3D delta wing model.
# On the surface, there is a triangle region that shows a pressure map, which is interpolated by "griddata" function, and the pressure data comes from 15 pressure ports. These 15 pressure ports are also shown on the surface.
